## Installing required libraries and loading them:
pkgs = c("tidyverse", "vegan", "patchwork", "lubridate", "FD", "tripack", "geometry", "matrixStats", "ape", 
         "clue", "cluster", "gtools")
for(p in pkgs){
  if(!require(p, character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(p)
  library(p, character.only = TRUE)
} 

## Data

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
